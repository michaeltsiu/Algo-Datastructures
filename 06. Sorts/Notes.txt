What is sorting?
  Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order
  Ex.
    - Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
    - Sorting names alphabetically
    - Sorting movies based on release year
    - Sorting movies based on revenue

Why learn this?
  - Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works
  - There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages

Objectives
  - Implement bubble -> selection -> insertion sort

Javascript sorting
  - The built-in sort method accepts an optional comparator function
  - You can use this comparator function to tell JS how you want it to sort
  - The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value
    - If it returns a negative number, a should come before based
    - If it returns a positive number, a should bome after b
    - If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned
  Ex. function numberCompair(num1, num2) {
        return num1 - num2; // smallest to largest
        return num2 - num1; // largest to smallest
      }
      [6, 4, 15, 10].sort(numberCompare); // [4, 6, 10, 15]
      function compareByLen(str1, str2) {
        return str1.length - str2.length // smallest to longest
        return str2.length - str1.length // longest to smallest
      }
